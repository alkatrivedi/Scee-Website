# SCEE WEBSITE
This goal of this repo is to make and maintain the SCEE Website.
Society of Civil and Environmental Engineering (SCEE) is the oldest and largest technical society of Delhi Technological University. 

## Front-end
The front-end will be carried out using Bootstrap.
A lot of front-end tasks have been done and a lot are still left.
This website needs to be completed by the end of October!

## Back-end
There is not much backend work here.
For simplicity sake we are planning to use NodeJS(tentative) as our back-end. 
Any and all new ideas are welcome!
